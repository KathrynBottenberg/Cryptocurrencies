# Cryptocurrencies

  Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

To do this, we have completed the following analysis:
Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
Part 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
Part 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
